I alternately use vim and emacs for my work. 
I use tmux to spawn different shells and create multiple panes lying around.
I have each one configured for my own use.


Setting up the environment:
=========


1. move the vim_config.vimrc file to your home directory and rename it to .vimrc
2. move the emacs_config file to your home directory and rename it to .emacs
3. move the tmux_config file to your home directory and rename it to .tmux.conf
